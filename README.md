# reddit_image_downloader

A quick and (very) dirty console app to download the 100 most recent submitted images for a user.

It's not clever, it's not exactly well written, and it'll likely stop working in the near future. But I wanted to pull some images quickly and it does the job. It'll basically run as fast as your network and the disk you're saving the images to allow.

If you want to take it and do something real with it, go right ahead, although there's no good lessons to be learned here.
